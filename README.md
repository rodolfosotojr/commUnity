# [comm**Unity** Web App](https://community-chicago.herokuapp.com)
A community building app targeting refugee communities within Chicago and connecting them with local families to help facilitate a smoother transition. 

## Overview
Human interaction is vital to thriving communities. Our App helps refugee communities that have left their homes, to resettle in Chicago by rebuilding their communities and connecting them with local families. Personal interaction is key to their success in adopting Chicago as a home, and our APP helps make that happen.

## Target audience:
Refugee communities that have resettled in Chicago, as well as local families willing to volunteer their time and resources.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
Clone or Download the Github repository at **(https://github.com/rodolfosotojr/commUnity)**
You will need to install the following software:
* Download and Install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**
* Download and Install **[MySql & MySql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)**
* You will need to provide your own `.env` for the Server and Client folders.
    * In root project folder the `.env` should contain `jwt-secret`, ChatKit Server, MapBox, and Cloudinary keys.
    * In /clients folder the `.env` should contain `jwt-secret`, ChatKit Cient keys.
* Create and download your ChatKit API key at **(https://pusher.com/chatkit)**
* Create and download your Cloudinary API key at **(https://cloudinary.com/)**
* Create and download your MapBox API key at **(https://www.mapbox.com/)**
* From your Gitbash/Terminal window, in the root project folder, run `npm install` to install all the required npm packages.
* Create the database in MySql Workbench: 
    * create a database called `community` and connect to the new database with `use community`
    * Run `npm start` to create the tables for the `community` database. After the application starts the back-end and front-end, you can stop the app by pressing `CTRL-C` twice.
    * To add Resource records to the Resources table, open the /models/Seeds.sql file in Workbench and execute the file.    

## Start the React Application
From your Gitbash/Terminal window, in the root project folder, run `npm start` to run both back-end and front-end node servers. You will now be able to view the local application in your browser at **(http://localhost:3000)**

## Programmer's Notes
Below are some of the challenges we faced creating the React app.

### ChatKit logic
* Volunteers will be able to see a list of private rooms linked to users.
* Users may be limited to a single volunteer or show volunteers that they have chatted with already.

### Upload Image
1. I append the username to the formData using `formData.append('username', this.props.globalusername)`
2. Upload response:
username = req.body.username
updated filename = req.file.filename
